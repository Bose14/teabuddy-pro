# Product Context

## Why This Exists
TeaBuddy Pro solves the daily operational challenges faced by small tea shop owners who currently manage finances manually or with basic spreadsheets. The app eliminates calculation errors, provides real-time insights, and helps owners make better business decisions.

## Problems It Solves

### 1. Manual Calculation Errors
- **Problem**: Shop owners waste time doing mental math or using calculators for daily reconciliation
- **Solution**: Auto-calculated daily sales, profits, and cash balances with verification alerts

### 2. Cash Discrepancy Detection
- **Problem**: Missing or unaccounted cash goes unnoticed until month-end
- **Solution**: Real-time expected vs actual cash comparison with instant alerts

### 3. Expense Tracking Chaos
- **Problem**: Receipts pile up, expenses get forgotten, difficult to categorize spending
- **Solution**: Instant expense entry with categories, payment methods, and vendor tracking

### 4. Stock Wastage
- **Problem**: Items expire unnoticed, inventory runs out unexpectedly
- **Solution**: Automated low stock alerts and expiry date warnings

### 5. Salary Confusion
- **Problem**: Advances paid informally, difficult to track who owes what
- **Solution**: Clear employee records with advance tracking and payment history

### 6. No Business Insights
- **Problem**: No visibility into trends, peak periods, or profitable patterns
- **Solution**: Visual charts showing sales trends, profit patterns, cash vs online splits
